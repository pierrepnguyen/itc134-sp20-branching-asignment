This is a party comedy with a strong theme of wisdom and the need for faith. 

The story is about a distant reporter who is in debt to a promiscuous librarian. 

It takes place in a town in a galaxy-spanning theocracy. 

The story begins with someone discovering a report about themselves and ends with someone borrowing money.
